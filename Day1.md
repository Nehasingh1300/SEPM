# Software Engineering
The establishment and use of engineering principles in order to obtain a economical, reliable and efficient software

##WATER FALL MODEL
The most familiar model with  five phases : 
Requirement Analysis and Specification phase  : Understanding exact requirement of customer and making software requirement specification(SRS)
Design Phase : Transform requirement specification into structure
Implementation and Unit Testing : Coding Phase with examination and modification of code. Small modules are tested in isolation.
Integratin and System Testing : All modules are tested together so that the interface between the modules is also correct.
Operation and Maintainance : Error correction, enhancement of capabilities, deletion of obsolete capabilities and optimization.

##INCREMENT MODEL 
There is no confusion in functionality of final product, after every cycle a useable product is given to customer for feedback.

###Iterative Enhancement Model
All phases as that of waterfall just that a useable product is released at the end of each cycle, with each release providing additional functionality. This model release an operational quality product at each release. Developer release product release by release.

###Rapid Application Development Model (RAD)
A prototype is build at the start of and is given to user for evaluation, feedback is obtained from the user and prototype is redefined. Process is continued till the requirements are finalised.<br>
1. Requirement Planning Phase : Requirements are captured<br>
2. User Description  : Review Requirement and may use automated tools<br>
3. Constructive Phase : Design, code, test<br>
4. Cut over phase : acceptance testing by user and installation of system and user training
<br>
##Prototyping Model
Developers use prototype to refine requirement and prepare final specifications. As the final prototype is checked by user so the requirement is meant to be fulfilled. And so this cycle repeat until a satisfactory prototype is achieved.

## Spiral Model
Each phase of Spiral Model is divided into four quadrants as shown in the above figure. The functions of these four quadrants are discussed below-
**Objectives determination and identify alternative solutions:** Requirements are gathered from the customers and the objectives are identified, elaborated and analyzed at the start of every phase. Then alternative solutions possible for the phase are proposed in this quadrant.<br>
**Identify and resolve Risks:** During the second quadrant all the possible solutions are evaluated to select the best possible solution. Then the risks associated with that solution is identified and the risks are resolved using the best possible strategy. At the end of this quadrant, Prototype is built for the best possible solution.
**Develop next version of the Product:** During the third quadrant, the identified features are developed and verified through testing. At the end of the third quadrant, the next version of the software is available.<br>
**Review and plan for the next Phase:** In the fourth quadrant, the Customers evaluate the so far developed version of the software. In the end, planning for the next phase is started.<br>
