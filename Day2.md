# Requirement Engineering
It describes the "what" of a system not  "how", produces a large documentation which describes what a system should do without describing how. The input to requirement engineering is the problem statement given by customer.<br>
## Crucial Steps
**Requirement Elicitation ** : gathering of requirement<br>
**Requirement Analysis** : Starts with requirement elicitation, Requirements are analyzed in order to identify inconsistencies, defects and omissions. Resolves Conflicts.<br>
**Requirement Documentation** : It will be foundation of design of software, Software Requirement Specification (SRS) <br>
**Requirement Review** : It improve quality of SRS, verification work and it is continuous activity that is incorporated with each step stated above.<br>
If it describes both H/W and S/W then it is System Requirement Specification and if it describes only software it is Software Requirement Specification.<br>
## Types Of Requirements
** Known Requirements** : Stakeholder believes to be implemented<br>
**Unknown Requirements** : Forogtten by stakeholder because they are not needed right now<br>
**Undreamt Requirements** : Could not think of new requirement due to limited knowledge<br>
### Functional Requirement 
Expectations from intended software, described what it has to do, Also known as product features, what software should not do.
### Non Functional Requirements
How well Software does what it has to do, include desired performance, availability, reliability, usability and flexibility

## Nature Of SRS
**Functionality : ** what software is supposed to do**<br>
**External Iterfaces : ** how software interact with other people, software , hardware and other software.<br>
**Performance : ** speed, availability, response time, recovery time.<br>
**Attributed : ** Considerations for portability,  correctness, maintainability, security and reliability<br>

## Characterstics Of Good SRS
**Correct : ** Every requirement should meet<br>
**Unambigous : ** Every requirement should have one interpretation<br>
** Complete : ** Include functionality, performance, design constrains, attributes, and external interface.<br>
**Consistent : ** No subset of individual requirement described.<br>
**Ranked for importance and/or stability : ** has an identifier indicate either the importance or stability of that particular requirement<br>
**Verifiable  :** cost effective way by which it can be check ed whether software meet requirements<br>
**Modifiable : ** Requirements can be changed easily, completely.<br>
**Traceable : ** Origin of each requirement is clear.<br>
