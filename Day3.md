#Metrics
**LocMetrics** counts total lines of code (LOC), blank lines of code (BLOC), comment lines of code (CLOC), lines with both code and comments (C&SLOC), logical source lines of code (SLOC-L), McCabe VG complexity (MVG), and number of comment words (CWORDS). Physical executable source lines of code (SLOC-P) is calculated as the total lines of source code minus blank lines and comment lines. Counts are calculated on a per file basis and accumulated for the entire project. LocMetrics also generates a comment word histogram.<br>
**Function Point Analysis (FPA)** is a method or set of rules of Functional Size Measurement. It assesses the functionality delivered to its users, based on the userâ€™s external view of the functional requirements. It measures the logical view of an application not the physically implemented view or the internal technical view.<br>
